# Song Similarity Calculator

## Project Overview:
Goals:

* Calculate the similarity between two songs using their sound/lyrics
* Recommend songs given user input of another song
* Use Spotify API to build playlist of recommended songs using our algorithm

Dataset: the million song dataset -- https://labrosa.ee.columbia.edu/millionsong/

Please read through this to get an idea of the data we’re working with

Methods: there are several ways to go about this; we will decide together

* Without neural nets: https://arxiv.org/pdf/1704.03844.pdf
* With recurrent neural nets: https://cs224d.stanford.edu/reports/BalakrishnanDixit.pdf
* With deep neural nets: http://cs229.stanford.edu/proj2017/final-reports/5218770.pdf
* A look into spotify: https://www.slideshare.net/MrChrisJohnson/algorithmic-music-recommendations-at-spotify

There’s a ton more resources out there -- just google “song similarity machine learning” or something like that
