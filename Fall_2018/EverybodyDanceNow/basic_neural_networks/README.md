# Introduction to Neural Networks

@version 10/03/2018

## Requirement/Recommendation
- Understanding of what classes and objects are in any programming language
- Basic Python experience
- Background in some Calculus (partial differentiation) and some Linear Algebra (matrix multiplications) would be helpful, but not required
- About at least 10 hours of your time

## First, watch [these videos](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLZHQObOWTQDNU6R1_67000Dx_ZCJB-3pi) as you take notes (like really carefully)
<strong>Don't just watch the videos and think you understood the basics.</strong> Make sure you are taking notes and listing questions. Google those questions and read whatever comes up slowly. 

This conceptual understanding should take a lot of time and that's normal. It is one of the most important skills that you can learn what you didn't know yesterday by googling today.


## Second, start diving into the code
