## Intro
Computer vision is an exciting, ever-growing field in computer science, and data
science specifically. With the development of powerful memory and processors,
real-time computer vision applications are becoming more and more popular.

Object detection and tracking in particular can provide significant useful
applications: vehicle tracking is used in self-driving cars so that autonomous
engines are able to effectively avoid collisions; movement tracking is used for
security purposes to identify unauthorized activities in off-limit areas;
tracking players in sports can be implemented for automatic foul detection.

In this project we will be building a real-time object tracking engine that
dynamically tracks objects in a computer webcam video and other video feeds.
The program allows its users to highlight a specific region in a video feed by
dragging the computer cursor. It then detects the particular object inside that
region, draws a rectangle around the object in the processed output video, and
finally tracks it throughout the whole video by moving the tracking rectangle
following the target.
