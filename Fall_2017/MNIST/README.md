# Classifying handwritten digits using the MNIST data set

By Elijah Anderson

This exploration will use a made-from-scratch neural network to examine how handwritten digits can be
classified by computers.

Some resources to check out if you're interested in learning more about machine learning:

1) http://neuralnetworksanddeeplearning.com/chap1.html

This project is heavily based on chapter 1, and will base much of its code on what the author provides for us. This
is a great read for anyone who wants to learn more about machine learning/neural networks.

2) https://docs.google.com/a/depauw.edu/presentation/d/1OePEVvaUG33XgSXMQJM7FdtVNCKoVhNPT2v_jRpl1us/edit?usp=sharing

If you're not a fan of reading a dense book about neural networks, I made a slide presentation that may make it easier
to understand.

3) https://www.tensorflow.org/get_started/mnist/beginners

Although we will be building our neural network from scratch, TensorFlow provides a great neural network library
and is great for people who don't want to get into the nitty gritty (i.e. mathematics) of machine learning.

This is the code that our import_mnist.py file borrows from. I made a few changes to make it compatible with
Python 3 and to make comments explaining what each part of it does.
